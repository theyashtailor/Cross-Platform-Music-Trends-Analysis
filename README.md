## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models to classify song popularity based on features like views, likes, and streaming numbers. We explore several machine learning approaches, including SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to determine the most effective model for predicting song popularity.

## Dataset
The dataset used originates from Kaggle and includes information from Spotify and YouTube, such as track details, engagement metrics, and genres. It provides a comprehensive basis for analyzing trends in music preferences across these platforms.

## Methodology
We applied various machine learning models, including:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with different kernels
- **Logistic Regression** with Lasso regularization
- **Random Forest**

Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Details on handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are included in the [project report](#).

## Results
The Logistic Regression model with Lasso regularization yielded the highest accuracy (99.47%) and precision (99.42%), proving to be the most effective in predicting item popularity. Detailed results and performance metrics for all models can be found in the [results section](#).
