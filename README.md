## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models to classify song popularity based on features like views, likes, and streaming numbers. We explore several machine learning approaches, including SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to determine the most effective model for predicting song popularity.

## Dataset
The dataset used originates from Kaggle and includes information from Spotify and YouTube, such as track details, engagement metrics, and genres. It provides a comprehensive basis for analyzing trends in music preferences across these platforms.

## Methodology
We applied various machine learning models, including:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with different kernels
- **Logistic Regression** with Lasso regularization
- **Random Forest**

Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Details on handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are included in the [project report](https://github.com/theyashtailor/Cross-Platform-Music-Trends-Analysis/blob/main/ALY%206110_Final_Report.pdf).

## Results
The Logistic Regression model with Lasso regularization yielded the highest accuracy (99.47%) and precision (99.42%), proving to be the most effective in predicting item popularity. Detailed results and performance metrics for all models can be found in the [results section](#).

## Conclusion

The Cross-Platform Music Trends Analysis project effectively utilized big data to uncover significant insights into music preferences and trends across major platforms like Spotify and YouTube. By analyzing extensive datasets, the project highlighted key differences in user engagement, pricing strategies, and popularity metrics across different cities and room types.

### Key Insights:
- **Pricing Trends:** The analysis revealed distinct pricing patterns across cities, with Denver and Los Angeles showing the highest average prices, indicating their popularity and potentially higher demand.
- **Review Patterns:** Seasonal trends in reviews showed that certain times of the year, such as March, experience peak user engagement, suggesting optimal times for artists and labels to release new content.
- **Room Type Preferences:** Data on room type preferences highlighted a clear preference for entire homes and hotel rooms over shared accommodations, reflecting a trend towards privacy and more luxurious travel experiences.

### Implications for Stakeholders:
- **Artists and Record Labels:** Insights from the analysis can guide promotional strategies and content release schedules to maximize engagement and revenue.
- **Streaming Platforms:** Understanding user preferences and engagement patterns can help platforms tailor their services to enhance user experience and satisfaction.
- **Advertisers and Marketers:** Detailed knowledge of pricing and popularity trends can inform more targeted and effective advertising campaigns.

The Cross-Platform Music Trends Analysis project demonstrates the power of big data in transforming industry strategies and offers a comprehensive tool for decision-makers in the music industry to stay ahead of changing trends and consumer preferences.
